# enviromental-measurement-esp32-solarpowered
This project was created due to the need to create the project as a bachelor's thesis.
The project is focused on the use of a microcontroller ESP32 for collecting data from sensors using communication buses. Data is published through MQTT messages to the MQTT server. Any MQTT client can remove data.
